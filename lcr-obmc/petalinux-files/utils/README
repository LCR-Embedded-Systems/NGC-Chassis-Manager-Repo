This directory contains various utilities to support the 
management of Petalinux-based OBMC builds.

Background:
Goal of this project was to add OpenBMC layers to a 
Petalinux BSP to produce a xilinx-based obmc. However,
Petalinux workflow and tools, in combination with the
various version mismatches between OpenBMC and Petalinux
introduced a huge hurdle that we were unable to overcome
before Phase 1 of the project closed.
Therefore, the interim solution was to use the incomplete
meta-lcr layer to produce an OpenBMC rootfs and continue
to use the Petalinux BSP to produce the bootloader, device-tree
and the kernel, then to manually combine the two projects
to create a post-build image.

After both projects are successfully built, these two files
are to be copied to '<petalinux project>/images/linux/.'
where they are to be used.

Files:

-import-obmc-files.sh
import-obmc-files.sh is intended to automate copying the correct
obmc rootfs files into the petalinux image directory.

-lcr-image.its
lcr-image.its is used by mkimage to produce an image.ub which
contains the merge of petalinux bootloader, device tree, and kernel
and the OBMC rootfs that was produced elsewhere.
